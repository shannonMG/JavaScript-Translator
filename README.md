# FlashCode - Increase your Coding Fluency

FlashCode is a web-based study tool designed to help users improve their coding fluency by practicing with flashcards. The application allows users to manage, and study coding prompts in an interactive manner. Users can track their progress by marking cards as mastered, removing them from the active deck, and focusing on the areas that need improvement.

# Features
**Dynamic Flashcards:** Users can load random coding prompts, submit answers, and view correct responses.
**Card Removal:** Ability to remove mastered cards from the active deck using a Bootstrap modal for confirmation.
**Local Storage Integration:** Cards marked as mastered are stored in local storage and excluded from future study sessions.
**Interactive UI:** Smooth card flipping animations allow users to view prompts and responses on a single card.
Progress Tracking: Users are redirected to a new URL when all cards are completed, indicating their progress.

# Technologies Used
**HTML** - used to structure the landing page, card page, and congratulations page
**CSS** - used to apply consistant style across all three pages, contributes to the flip visuals
**JavaScript** - used to determine the available deck, display card information, ensures cards always display prompt first, moves card to local storage if requested by the user.
**BootStrap** - bootstrap was used to style all buttons, the input field and the confirmation modal.
